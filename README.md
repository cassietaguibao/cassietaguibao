- 👋 Hi, I’m @cassietaguibao
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics for professional development, sewing for relief, and being the best parent I can be.
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning Excel, SQL, and PowerBI. Once I feel confident, I aim to apply to a Masters in Analytics program... preferrable Georgia Tech's OMSA.
- 💞️ I’m looking for study buddies, mentors, and... a job. 
- 📫 How to reach me... let's figure that out later.
