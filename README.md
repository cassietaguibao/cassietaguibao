- 👋 Hi, I’m @cassietaguibao
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics for professional development, sewing for relief, and being the best parent I can be.
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning Excel, SQL, and PowerBI. My goal is to become a data analyst, and work towards a Masters in Analytics before (ideally, after) I get my foot in the door.
- 💞️ I’m looking for study buddies, mentors, and... a job. 
- 📫 How to reach me... let's figure that out later.
